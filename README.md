# Retail Sales Data Analysis 📊

This project involves analyzing a retail sales dataset using Microsoft Excel to uncover valuable insights about sales performance across **gender, age groups (also referred to as generations)**, and **product categories**. In addition to basic analysis, I’ve created **Commission** and **Total Sales** columns to enhance the dataset’s usability. 

I utilized a combination of Excel functions like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `VLOOKUP`, `UNIQUE`, `SUMIF`, `SUMIFS`, **cell referencing**, **pivot tables**, **slicers**, and **pivot charts** to analyze and visualize the data effectively.

## 📌 Project Overview 

The dataset contains key retail sales details, including:

- **Customer Gender** 🚻
- **Age Group / Generation** 🎂
- **Product Category** 🛍️
- **Sales Value** 💰
- **Commission Earned** 💵

I analyzed how different **age groups (generations)** impact sales performance across various product categories. The **Commission** and **Total Sales** columns were calculated based on sales data to measure overall revenue and commission-based earnings.

## ⚙️ Key Features and Excel Functions Used 

- **Commission & Total Sales Columns**:  
   - Created **Commission** column to calculate the percentage earned from sales.  
   - **Total Sales** column aggregates overall revenue, including commissions.  

- **SUM & AVERAGE**: Used to compute total sales and average performance across gender, age group (generation), and product categories.  

- **VLOOKUP**: Applied to match customer demographics with their respective purchase data.  

- **UNIQUE**: Extracted distinct customer groups (e.g., gender, age categories) for segmentation analysis.  

- **SUMIF & SUMIFS**: Used to analyze total sales based on criteria like gender, age group, and product category.  

- **Cell Referencing**: Implemented for structured calculations across multiple sheets, ensuring data consistency.  

- **Pivot Tables**: Built to summarize sales by gender, category, and age group for deeper insights.  

- **Pivot Charts**: Created to visualize the distribution of sales performance across different segments.  

- **Slicers**: Enabled interactive filtering for easy data exploration by category, gender, and age group.
